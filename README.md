# Vehicle Builder CLI

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to enhance my understanding of TypeScript, object-oriented programming, and to create a practical tool that could be used to simulate real-world scenarios involving vehicles. I also wanted to practice using popular Node.js packages like Inquirer for user input. The project solves the problem of managing different vehicle types through a command-line interface, allowing users to create, select, and perform actions on vehicles. It demonstrates how to add new functionality, such as handling different vehicle types. I learned how to implement object-oriented principles in TypeScript, manage user input through the Inquirer package, and extend classes to handle different functionalities for various vehicle types. I also gained experience in organizing a project repository and documenting it effectively.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mirasoldavila13/Vehicle-Builder-CLI.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Vehicle-Builder-CLI`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the TypeScript files: `npm run build`

## Usage

To start the application, use the command: `npm start` The CLI will guide you through the process of creating or selecting a vehicle, and you can then perform various actions with the selected vehicle. After each action, you will be returned to the actions menu until you decide to exit the application. The application uses the Inquirer package to collect input from the user, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the Vehicle Builder CLI project are welcome and greatly appreciated. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:**

- Navigate to the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/mirasoldavila13/Vehicle-Builder-CLI`.
- Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository:**

- Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Vehicle-Builder-CLI.git`
- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

3. **Create a New Branch:**

- Itâ€™s important to create a new branch before making any changes. This keeps your contributions organized and separated from the main codebase: `git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`
- Replace `YourFeatureName` with a name that describes the feature or fix you're working on.

4. **Make Your Changes:**

- Make the necessary changes to the codebase in your local repository. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
- If you're adding a new feature, consider updating the README or other documentation to reflect the changes.

5. **Commit Your Changes:**

- Once you've made your changes, commit them with a descriptive commit message: `git commit -m "Add detailed description of the feature or fix"`
- Commit messages should be clear and concise, explaining what changes were made and why.

6. **Push Your Changes to GitHub:**

- Push your changes to the branch you created on your forked repository: `git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`

7. **Open a Pull Request:**

- Go to the original repository on GitHub (`https://github.com/mirasoldavila13/Vehicle-Builder-CLI`) and you'll see a message about your recent push, along with a button to "Compare & pull request."
- Click that button, provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request, and submit it for review.

8. **Respond to Any Review Feedback:**

- The repository maintainers may provide feedback or request changes to your pull request. Be sure to address any comments or concerns they raise.
- Once all feedback is addressed, your pull request will be merged into the main codebase.

9. **Celebrate Your Contribution:**

- Congratulations, you've successfully contributed to the Vehicle Builder CLI project! Thank you for helping to improve the project.

## Tests

At this time, the Vehicle Builder CLI project does not include automated tests or use a testing framework. However, contributors are encouraged to test their changes manually by running the application locally to ensure everything works as expected.To manually test the application:

1. Follow the installation steps to set up the project on your local machine.
2. Start the application using `npm start`.
3. Interact with the CLI to create and manage vehicles, ensuring that all features work as intended.
4. Verify that new features or changes do not introduce any errors or unexpected behavior.While automated testing is not currently implemented, you are welcome to contribute by adding tests or proposing a testing strategy for the project. If you do so, please provide detailed instructions on how to run the tests in the README.
